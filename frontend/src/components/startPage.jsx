                We have a map feature in our web app.As soon as someone feels
                threat, they would use our pukaar app for sending SOS message,
                their location will be plotted on the web app map and this
                location can be seen by all the pukaar users so anyone can help
                that girl. It also shows the number of routes along with the
                best possible route from her current location to her home.

                (for simplicity purpose, we know 2 ether = 29,220.92 Indian
                Rupee) will be deducted from her account to the saviour's
                etherium account.
